The National Sample Survey 75th Round report indicates the stark digital divide between rural and urban education in India.
With a mission to ensure basic education in rural India, we propose a multi-faceted solution by not only providing an e-learning android app platform but with the much needed projection technology integration. This would work the same way people would binge on cricket matches in rural areas, the projector however shrinked now to a compact device.

Our compact device would make use of a simple projection mechanism and an SD-card enabling immersive learning experience. The android
application would be made available to school representatives handling smooth upload/download of resources.

For this we have interfaced Esp32, SD card reader and an 0.96 inch OLED display . We have added a Micro SD card to the ESP32 to store data. The study material that is saved in the SD card from the app is inserted in the SD card reader.
